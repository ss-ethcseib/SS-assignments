To run the program you want to use the start.sh
script or the StartTests.sh script. You could
also build the programs yourself using make
and make tests. The output of the scripts
and makefile commands should be bankcli and
tests. 

Notes:
	The username and password for bankcli
	is root and password.

Future plans:
       I really want to get the password encryption working.
