The FloatPrecision program looks at two infamous floating point
numbers that are known to repeat forever and see if, when expanded,
lose precision due to computer limitations.

The WorkingWithTypes program takes input from the user after started
and returns the size of the primitive they asked for. The limitation
of the program comes down to the fact we were told to use cin which
only retrieves user input up to the first white space. Meaning that
only "long" is read in when the user enters "long int".
