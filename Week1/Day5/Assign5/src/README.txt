This program accepts command line arguments from the user. These
arguments are meant to be dimensions for the matrices and follow the
order of matrxAY matrixAX matrixBX matrixBY. I have also made
a bash script that takes dimensions for just one matrix as command
line arguments and uses those to create the second matrix.
