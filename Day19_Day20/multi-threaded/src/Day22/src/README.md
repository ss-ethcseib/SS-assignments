From previous assignments I had already broken down the performance of my functions. Specifically, I mentioned I was able to reduce my force calculations from O(n^2) to O(nlogn) where n is the number of bodies in the first assignment. Now, these force calculations had to be done just n number of times. Here is why. In my duration while loop I start one thread for each body to do these calculations. Inside the threads the calculations are O(logn). This took some time for me to figure out. There are n number of threads created and in these threads O(logn) amount of work is done. However, these are separate threads. We ultimately wait at the std::thread.join() for O(logn) time. This makes the multi-threaded version to have a time complexity of O(mlogn) where m is the total number of steps within a duration. This makes sense because we have to wait m times for a logn time duration. We can only achieve this performance because these calculations are happening simultaneously. Now, I don't take the other calculations in consideration because they are all constant time calculations.

Best case: O(mlogn)
Worst case: O(mlogn)
